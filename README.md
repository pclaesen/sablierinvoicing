# Sablier Invoicing

The Sablier Invoicing app allows anyone to create a decentralised paper trail for Sablier streams.

The app can be accessed [here](https://sablierinvoicing.vercel.app).

## Supported chains:
| Chain        | Type |
| -----------  | ----------- |
| Sepolia      | Testnet       |

## Decentralised paper trail
Under the hood, our app uses [Request Network](https://request.network) to store the invoice data on IPFS.
This ensures the immutability of your invoices and allows you to always access your data.
